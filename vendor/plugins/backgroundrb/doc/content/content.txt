*BackgrounDRb* is a Ruby job server and scheduler. Its main intent is to be
used with Ruby on Rails applications for offloading long-running tasks.
Since a Rails application blocks while serving a request it is best to
move long-running tasks off into a background process that is divorced
from http request/response cycle.

%(entry-title)<a name="installation"> Installation </a>%

p(sub-title). Installing the dependencies :

As of version 1.0.3 _BackgrounDRb_ depends on _chronic_ and _packet_ gems. Thus lets get
started by installing these two gems:

<pre class="boxed">sudo gem install chronic packet </pre>

Please note that, this version of _BackgrounDRb_ needs packet version 0.1.5 or greater, so make
sure you have that. 

p(sub-title). Getting the code from Subversion :

<pre class="boxed"> svn co http://svn.devjavu.com/backgroundrb/trunk </pre>

p(sub-title). Installing from Git:

As of version 1.0.3 __BackgrounDRb__ development has moved to gitorious. Above SVN url
will always mirror stable releases from Git. However to enjoy latest and greatest of features
you can install the plugin from git:

<pre class="multiline">
git clone git://gitorious.org/backgroundrb/mainline.git backgroundrb </pre>

p(sub-title). Installation using Piston

<pre class="boxed">piston import http://svn.devjavu.com/backgroundrb/trunk/ backgroundrb </pre>

%(entry-title)<a name="configuration"> Configuration </a>%

After getting the plugin, you must configure it for use. _BackgrounDRb_ comes with a rake task
for automating plugin configuration. Run, following command from root directory of your rails
application, after installation:

<pre class="boxed">rake backgroundrb:setup </pre>

Above Command does following things :

*(content_list) Creates a config file @backgroundrb.yml@ in config directory of your rails application.
* Creates @RAILS_ROOT/lib/workers@ direcotry for keeping BackgrounDRb workers in one place.
* Creates @RAILS_ROOT/test/bdrb_test_helper.rb@ as a test helper for your workers

p(sub-title). Configuration Options

A default @backgroundrb.yml@ file looks like this:

<pre class="multiline">
:backgroundrb:
  :port: 11006
  :ip: 0.0.0.0 </pre>

However, various other configuration options are available. For example, to load @production@
environment in your workers:

<pre class="multiline">
:backgroundrb:
  :port: 11006
  :ip: 0.0.0.0 
  :environment: production </pre>


Following file demonstrates other available configuration options:

<pre class="multiline">
---
:backgroundrb:
  :port: 11006 # port to start listen
  :ip: localhost # host to listen
  :environment: production # rails environment to load
  :log: foreground # foreground mode,print log messages on console
  :lazy_load: true # do not load models eagerly
  :debug_log: false # disable log workers and other logging </pre>

@lazy_load@ option should be true if you want to pass @ActiveRecord@ model
objects around, However, this option is generally not encouraged to use, 
because if your model makes use of some other ActiveRecord plugin and 
plugin is not available during load, loading of model will fail. In 
new version of BackgrounDRb its generally discouraged to pass model objects around, 
since they are harder to serialize and deserialize.

%(entry-title)<a name="worker"> Workers </a>%

Once you are set with initial configuration, you can proceed to create worker and start
_BackgrounDRb_ server. To generate a worker:

<pre class="boxed"> ./script/generate worker billing </pre>

Output will look something like:

<pre class="multiline">exists  lib/workers/
create  lib/workers/billing_worker.rb </pre>

And generated worker will look like: 

<pre class="multiline">class BillingWorker < BackgrounDRb::MetaWorker
  set_worker_name :billing_worker
  def create(args = nil)
    # method gets called, when new instance of worker is created.                      
   end
  end </pre>


You can define worker specific initialization in @create@ method. Tasks that are to be executed
in this worker should be defined as seperate methods. For example:

<pre class="multiline">class BillingWorker < BackgrounDRb::MetaWorker
  set_worker_name :billing_worker
  def create(args = nil)
    # this method is called, when worker is loaded for the first time
  end
  
  def charge_customer(customer_id = nil)
    logger.info 'charging customer now'
  end
end </pre>

%(entry-title)<a name="invoking_tasks"> Invoking Tasks </a>%

Task @charge_customer@ defined in @BillingWorker@ can be invoked in several ways. To beging with
it can be invoked from rails or can be scheduled to execute at particular interval using
cron like syntax.

p(sub-title). Invoking Task from Rails :

In your Rails controllers you have access to proxy class @MiddleMan@ which can be used
to interact with BackgrounDRb server, either from Rails controllers/Models or from Rails console.
For example to invoke @charge_customer@ method one can use:

<pre class="boxed">MiddleMan.worker(:billing_worker).charge_customer(current_customer.id) </pre>

Above code can be also executed from Rails console.

p(sub-title). Start the BackgrounDRb server :

You can use:

<pre class="boxed">./script/backgroundrb start </pre>

For more options:

<pre class="boxed">./script/backgroundrb --help </pre>

As documented above, you can use @backgroundrb.yml@ file to load different rails environments, however you can use:

<pre class="boxed">./script/backgroundrb -e development </pre>
