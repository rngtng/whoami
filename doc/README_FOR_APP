Welcome to WhoAmI

WhoAmI is a tool to aggregate your personal media shared on the internet. Everything what you share, your images,
videos, bookmarks, music, blog posts etc. are merged into one place. The content is analyzed on keywords, permalinks
and mapped to a simple ontology. If no tags are available the content is automatically tagged. Is a tag identified as
location its geodata is added.

The resulting semantic relations are visualized via tagcloud, timeline, map or in detail. For further processing,
your media can be accessed via RSS Feed or iCal (e.g. adding to your feed reader or calendar).

Primary access to the data is established trough the APIs of the web-services. Therefore your password or 
authorization has to be provided. If you feel uncomfy giving away your data, just provide your username. This falls 
back to public accessible RSS/Atom feeds. Although this doesn't give access to data of the past, your future content
is processed as nearly good as content aggregated via API.
